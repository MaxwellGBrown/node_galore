Node Galore
===========

This is an exploration of node.js as a back end service.

I've been reluctant to begin exploring this because I *really* like Python.
But it's probably about time I try learning more about JavaScript than just React.

I'm basing this first run on the `StackOverflow node.js tutorial <https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/node.js/340/getting-started-with-node-js#t=201708230005090196811>`__
